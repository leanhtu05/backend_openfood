# Fixing Groq API Integration

## Problem Description

The Groq API integration was failing with the following error:

```
Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

This error occurs because the Groq Python client library (version 0.4.0) doesn't support the `proxies` parameter in its `Client` or `Groq` class initialization. While older versions might have supported this parameter, the current version does not.

## Attempted Solutions

Several approaches were tried to fix this issue:

1. **Removing the proxies parameter**: Attempted to modify the client initialization to remove the `proxies` parameter.

2. **Using different client classes**: Tried both `groq.Client` and `groq.Groq` classes, but both had the same issue.

3. **Dynamic imports**: Attempted to use dynamic imports to avoid potential import-time monkey patching.

## Final Solution

The successful approach was to create a direct HTTP client implementation that doesn't use the Groq Python library directly, but instead makes HTTP requests to the Groq API endpoints.

### Implementation Details

1. Created a `DirectGroqClient` class in `groq_integration_direct.py` that:
   - Uses the `httpx` library for HTTP requests
   - Handles authentication with the Groq API key
   - Implements methods for listing models and generating completions

2. Updated the `GroqService` class to use this direct client instead of the official Groq client.

3. The direct implementation avoids any issues with the `proxies` parameter and provides a stable interface for the application.

### Usage

To use the fixed implementation:

```python
from groq_integration_direct import groq_service

# Use the service as before
meals = groq_service.generate_meal_suggestions(
    calories_target=500,
    protein_target=30,
    fat_target=15,
    carbs_target=60,
    meal_type="breakfast"
)
```

## Testing

The fix was tested with the `check_groq_direct.py` script, which successfully:
- Initialized the Groq service
- Listed available models 
- Generated meal suggestions

## Future Improvements

1. Add better error handling for API responses
2. Implement async support for better performance
3. Add more robust caching for API responses
